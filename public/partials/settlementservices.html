                        We prepare HUD settlement statement based upon lender’s closing instructions and the requirements of the title insurance
                        commitment. We will provide the preliminary HUD settlement statement to the lender and/or investor for approval
                        prior to the physical signing, if necessary. We use the closing instructions provided by the lender to the
                        Title Company to complete the statement overnight.
